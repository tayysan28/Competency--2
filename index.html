	<h1>Taylor</h1>
	My name is Taylor Almeida and I'm going to school to get my Associate of Applied Science Degree to become a User Expereince and User Interface designer, also known as UX/UI. I'm from Yona Guam, however I reside in Austin, Texas. I'm very passionate in art, fitness, and music. It helps me clear my mind and focus on the better things in life. 

	I spend alot of my time with my five year old son, by creating, drawing, swimming, watching movies, and rollder skating together. I enjoy working at American Airlines as a ramp agent. I am able to travel wherever and whenever I want to in this world. Seeing the world is exciting to me. I believe that, learning  about other people's cultures is important. It helps me to connect and understand how others are and how being different can be a beautiful thing..
